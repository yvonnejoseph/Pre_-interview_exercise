# Pre_-interview_exercise
Pre-interview exercise

With the 45mins allocated for the task I managed to do the main HTML structure and some of the CSS code up to the point of starting to style the footer section.
With more time I would have added the footer code and @ media section of the CSS.
My main aim was to follow the brief as much as possible and see how far I would get in 45min and see what extras I would have added given a bit more time.

The completed code version can be found here:

Kind regards,
